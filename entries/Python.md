# Python

Python is a programming language that can be used both for writing **command-line scripts** or building **web applications**.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31][32]
