# XML

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related specifications[4] - all of them free open standards - define XML.[5]
